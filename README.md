## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

I've attached a screenshot of my solution in the desktop mode. I was honestly unable to snag a good screenshot in mobile mode, as I ran into an issue there. I'll go into more detail further in the README.


## My process
I'm a beginner web developer so it took me a fair amount of time to put this together. I was capable enough with flexbox to slap together the correct orientations (e.g. align-items, justify-content, etc) however it took some trial and error. I had to remind myself on how to make the CSS dynamic, as well as how to apply gradients.

My main challenges were this:
-Finding a streamlined workflow
-Finding the least complex way to group together items for easy CSS styling
-Correctly applying flexbox to the "Summary" elements
-Applying the correct code for the mobile design

With that in mind, I would appreciate any feedback on the above attributes. Thank you so much!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned
While I am still learning how to best organize my workflow, I'm happy with the organizational principles I applied in my code here. 

Practically, I learned how to apply gradients and box shadows.
